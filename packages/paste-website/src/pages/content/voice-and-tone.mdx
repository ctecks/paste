## What are voice and tone?
**Voice is the foundation of every written or spoken communication.** 
Voice makes us – Twilio – identifiable, consistent, and familiar. 

**Tone is the how you modify what you say to convey emotion or intent.** 
Tone enables you to choose words, structures, punctuation, or syntax appropriate to the scenario. 

<Callout>
  <CalloutTitle as="h4">Voice or tone?</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>Think of your best friend. You can recognize their voice - that doesn't change. But how they speak in a job interview is different from how they chat with you at the weekend. They sound the same – *that’s voice* – but they change *how* they express themselves – *that’s tone*.

### Twilio Voice and tone
**The Twilio Voice is always human, accurate, and authentic.** 
That’s how we sound. These characteristics don’t change. 

**Our tone has four qualities: positive, conversational, encouraging, and knowledgeable.** 
The exact mix changes to meet the user’s needs and situation.

## The Twilio Voice
All Twilio content uses the Twilio Voice, which has three core characteristics:
- Human
- Accurate
- Authentic

#### Human = write with the user in mind
Users succeed when they achieve their goal efficiently and have a positive experience. 
Create content that appeals to both their head and heart – content that you'd want to read.

**How?**
- Reduce cognitive load by using common words in simple, short structures. 
- Be empathetic and consider the user's situation and emotional state.
- Offer appropriate reactions, just as you would face-to-face. 


#### Accurate = write with precision
Users need our content to be accurate. 
They rely on the words we use to help them achieve their goal. 
A user should never be surprised by what content means.

**How?**
- Use consistent language for features and products.  
- Give the user all the information they need to make a decision. 
- Remember, you are not the user. 

#### Authentic = write transparently

Users need our content to be truthful and evidence-based. 
They rely on our products to do what they say. 
Being evasive or exaggerating isn’t useful and impacts the user’s trust in our products.

**How?**
- Be clear about what is and isn’t possible, particularly with beta or pilot features. 
- Never suggest or claim that the product does something it can’t deliver. 
- Test the product rigorously so you can be confident and precise about its functions.

## Tone

Tone is used to modify how we communicate, according to the scenario and the user’s situation. 
Think of tone as a stabilizer tool. 

We want our users to feel

- Confident
- At ease
- Empowered
- Reassured

To do that, we use a combination of tonal qualities

- Positive
- Conversational
- Encouraging
- Knowledgeable

### Tonal qualities
#### Positive 
You're efficient but warm. When the user wins, you recognize their success genuinely. 

**Sounds** 
Engaging, upbeat, and forward-looking 

**Doesn't sound**
Annoying, hyperbolic, or misleading 

| Do front-load the content with the reason (why) then the action (how) | Don't add empty phrases or punctuation to try and sound positive|
|:--|:--|
| *To get started, add a user* |	*First up, add a user, then we can get going!* |

#### Conversational 
You’re speaking to the user in person. You're on friendly, but professional terms.

| Sounds | Doesn't sound |
|:--|:--|
| Friendly, approachable, and straightforward | Colloquial, idiomatic, or over-familiar |

| Do use common contractions (you’ll, we’re, let’s) | Don't use slang or idioms – these can exclude users and obscure meaning |
|:--|:--|
| *Let's get started* |	*Let’s get this show on the road* |

Avoid sounding robotic or sacrificing meaning to save space. Shorter is not always better.

| Do choose the words that most accurately and clearly communicate what the user needs to do | Don't prioritize space or design over comprehension or natural, conversational language |
|:--|:--|
| *Create Agent profile* |	*Create* |

#### Encouraging
Show empathy, advise, and guide. Show the user how to succeed to give them confidence.

| Sounds | Doesn't sound |
|:--|:--|
| Helpful, reassuring, and supportive | Patronizing, impatient, or impatient |

| Do say *please* if the user is making additional effort. Provide context and useful information | Don't precede an instruction with *just* or frame it as being easy or simple |
|:--|:--|
| *To apply changes, please reload the page* |	*To apply changes, just reload the page* |
| *Change an Agent's skill level in Agent Profile* | *Change an Agent's skill level easily in Agent Profile* |


#### Knowledgeable
Empower the user with information. Show them the edges of the flow and signpost what’s next to enable discovery.
 Avoid surprising them with another step.

| Sounds | Doesn't sound
|:--|:--|
| Informative, guiding, and clear | Dictatorial, superior, or know-it-all |

| Do say *please* if the user is making additional effort. Provide context and useful information | Don't make the user guess what an interaction will do |
|:--|:--|
| *To see available options, select a category* |	*Select category* |

## Finding the right tone 

Identify the user, their place in the experience, what they need, and their emotional state. Put yourself in their shoes. 

| Interaction | Context | User need | Approach |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Neutral | A repeated interaction (Login screen, confirmation message) | Familiarity and recognition. Efficiency, nothing unusual, and no friction | Conversational and positive. Be efficient, approachable, and unobtrusive |
| Positive | A high point (Completion of a complex flow, first-time success with a process) | Confirmation of success. A positive affirmation and clear next step | Positive and encouraging. Be congratulatory and forward-looking |
| Negative | An error or problem (Access denied, system failure) | Resolution and reassurance. A clear solution and reassurance | Knowledgeable and encouraging. Be clear, informative, and calm |

Tone balances the interaction, leaving the user in a net-positive place emotionally. 


Every interaction deserves consideration. If you can write in the Twilio Voice and use appropriate tonal qualities, your content has a strong, user-focused foundation.
