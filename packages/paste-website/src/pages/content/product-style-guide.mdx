## Content principles

#### Identify your user and speak directly to them
- Consider who you're writing for and their technical level. Use words the user is familiar with.
- Address the user as *you*, refer to Twilio as *we*.

#### Write for the reading level of a 10-13 year old
- Use simple, short sentences and common words.
- Explain technical terms and write acronyms in full the first time a user sees them.

  <CalloutTitle>Using readability tools</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    Sites offering <Anchor href="https://readabilityformulas.com/free-readability-formula-tests.php">free readability tools like this one</Anchor> can be useful for assessing the "reading age" of long content (more than 150 words).
    However, they're not great at testing short UI content that might only contain two or three words.
    Use them with caution. Look for a simpler word whenever you can to improve the readability of your content.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

#### Be inclusive of people and devices
- Avoid *click, tap, touch* instructions as not every device supports touch.
- Instead, use *select* to instruct a user to interact.
- Avoid relying on drectional or color-based cues &mdash; *to the right, the blue button*. These are problematic for responsive products or users who see colors differently.
- Instead, write *the main menu* or *the dropdown menu*. Name the component or area you’re referencing.

#### Write as if the user is in a rush
- Avoid repetition and padding.
- Phrases we use when writing formally or presenting &mdash; *please note, so, in fact, in other words* &mdash; should be cut.
- Chunk content and use headings to help the user scan for what they need.

#### Be direct and straightforward
- Lead with the reason (why), by front-loading messages with words that address the user’s needs.
- Leave the user with a clear instruction of how to address that need.
- Avoid relying on company/industry jargon, idioms, or cultural references to communicate what you mean.
- Use the words that are most familiar to the user.

#### It’s ok to bend grammatical rules to sound natural
- End sentences with prepositions &mdash; *of, with, for* &mdash; if it sounds less awkward.
- And you can start sentences with *But* or *And*.
- Use contractions with pronouns &mdash; *it’s, there’s, you’ll, we’ll, you’re* &mdash; to sound conversational.

<Callout>
  <CalloutTitle>Exception: avoid contractions in error messages</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    Avoid contractions in negative scenarios. When a user is stressed, their comprehension suffers.
    Often users will read <em>can’t</em> as <em>can</em>, missing the -’t at the end.
    Write out error messages or destructive action warnings in full.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

## Punctuation

#### Ampersands &
**Avoid using ampersands.** In exceptional circumstances, if space is unavoidably restricted or it's part of a product/brand name, use "&".

**Do** use "and" instead of an ampersand (&).
- *Voice and messaging*
- *Create and submit a Regulatory Bundle.*
- *Messages sent from AT&T to Twilio numbers are not impacted.*

**Don't** use "&" just to make content shorter. IF space is an issue, address the content and design together.

  <Callout>
    <CalloutTitle>Why?</CalloutTitle>
    <CalloutText> Using "and" rather than the ampersand symbol (&) supports localization and users with lower literacy or cognitive impairments.
    Some screen readers can’t interpret the code behind an ampersand, which obscures the meaning for the user.
    </CalloutText>
  </Callout>

#### Apostrophes '
**Do** use an apostrophe to indicate possession or belonging.
- The APIs of Twilio > Twilio's APIs
  - *The phone number's prefix.*
  - *Choose from one of SendGrid's responsive email designs.*

**Do** use an apostrophe to indicate missing letters.
- You are > you're
  - *You're not logged in.*

**Don't** use apostrophes to make a plural. We should never see *Upgrade to buy phone number's*, *Install plugin's*, or *SID's*.

#### Commas ,
**Do** use the serial or 'Oxford' comma in a list of 3 or more items.
- *You can customize the agent desktop, channels, interaction routing, and reporting.*

#### Exclamation marks !
**Do** use a single exclamation mark to support a celebration. But never more than one at a time (!!)
- *Congratulations, you sent your first email!*

**Don't** use exclamation marks to draw attention to or emphasise an error message or alert.
Exclamation marks can increase anxiety or sound like shouting. Unless it's a clear moment of success, don't use them.

#### Hyphens and dashes - &ndash; &mdash;
**Do** use hyphens (-) to create compound words.
- Hyphens never have a space either side.
  - *Add-on feature*

**Do** use en-dashes (&ndash;) indicate a range of values (time, dates, numerical amounts.)
- En-dashes never have a space either side.
  - *0-50 agents*
  - Tip: If your system does not support en-dashes, use a hyphen to indicate range.

**Avoid** using em-dashes (&mdash;) to create an emphatic pause.
- Tip: It's ok to write a very short sentence to emphasise its meaning.
We might use em-dashes with friends and colleagues in email and chat to signify an added thought, but the user needs clarity over what's important.
Give the thought a sentence or restructure your syntax.

#### Parentheses ( )
**Do** use parentheses to provide an example or explanation.
- *Password must contain a special character (&, @, %, $, ^)*

**Do** use parentheses to note an acronym the first time a user encounters it.
- *Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a mechanism for securing your SIP connections.*
  - In this example, the user is familiar with the term "SIP" but not "TLS."

#### Periods .
**Do** end every full sentence with a period
- *Enable Flex Dialpad in Console.*
- *Sign up for a free account.*

**Don't** use periods at the end of fragments or incomplete sentences.

#### Quotation marks " "
**Do** use quotation marks to pick out words from a component or a file name.
- *Select "Apply changes"*
- *We recommend using dedicated accounts for your development environments, like "Flex Production" and "Flex Development."*

**Do** put punctuation inside quotation marks, if necessary.
- *To create a new project, select "Create My Flex Project."*

**Don't** use quotation marks to refer to products or features.
Products and features are proper nouns and should be capitalized to differentiate them.

#### Semicolons ;
**Avoid using semicolons.** In formal writing, semicolons are useful. In product content, they can be messy and confusing.
- If you feel your sentence needs a semicolon, simplify it or create two sentences.

**Do** use punctuation and conjunctions (*and*, *but*, *so*) to separate thoughts.
- List complex items that already contain a comma using bullet points. For example, state capitals
  - *Montgomery, Alabama*
  - *Juneau, Alaska*
  - *Phoenix, Arizona*

## Grammar and formatting

#### Abbreviations
Coming in the next release

#### Acronyms
**Do** write the phrase in full, followed by the acronym in parentheses the first time a user encounters it.
- *Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a mechanism for securing your SIP connections.*
  - In this example, the user is familiar with the term "SIP" but not "TLS."

#### American English
**Do** use American English spellings throughout products.
- *Behavior, dialed, color, artifact, center, license* (for both verb and noun), *-ize* endings, *program* (for all meanings)

#### Bold and italics
Coming in the next release

#### Capitalization
**Do** capitalize proper nouns – products, people, places.
- If a brand or product name uses a mix of upper and lower case (TwiML, eBay) use the name's convention.
- Products include features, programs, or systems that Twilio has given a specific name to.
- People are named individuals or identifiable roles.
  - *Kris Brunner, Chief Engineer*
  - *Contact your System Administrator*

**Don't** capitalize general terms (*email, contact center, platform*)
- Tip: If it's something Twilio has created or owns, it takes a capital.

#### Code snippets
Coming in the next release

#### Dates
Coming in the next release

#### I/You/We/Us
**Do** refer to the user as *you* and to Twilio as *we*.
- Tip: If the user has agency or ownership, use ‘I’ or ‘my’.
  - *If you still can’t connect, contact our support team.*
  - *I understand.* (This usage is almost exclusively for consent.)
  - *To access billing information, select My Account.*

#### Lists (all)
**Do** start each list item with the same part of speech – usually a noun or verb – to make the list "parallel."
- Puncutate the end of each iteam with a full point if it is a complete sentence.
- Be consistent within the list. If one item takes a full point, all items should.

**Don't** punctuate the end of an item in a vertical list with a comma or elipses "..."

#### Lists (bullet points)
- **Do** use bulleted lists for items linked by a topic. Make the list topic clear in the sentence or heading that precedes it.

#### Lists (numbered)
- **Do** use numbered lists for items to be done or understood in a sequence.
- **Avoid** listing more than 7 items.

#### Lists (sentence)
**Do** use a sentence list if you’re explaining a short process, noting up to four options, or highlighting up to four key points. You just read a sentence list.
- Sentence lists should be used for no more than four items. Over four? List with bullet points.
- Use the Oxford comma before the last item in a sentence list.

#### Numbers
Coming in the next release

#### Sentence case
**Do** use sentence case everywhere unless specifically guided otherwise. Sentence case makes content feel more human and it's generally easier to scan.
- This is sentence case. (Use this.)
- This is Title Case. (Rarely use this, and only if directed.)
- THIS IS ALL CAPS. (Don’t use this.)

#### Time
Coming in the next release
- Static time
- Time span
- Ongoing time
