## Content principles

- **Identify your user and speak directly to them**
  - Consider who you're writing for and their technical level – use words they're familiar with. 
  - Address the user as you, refer to Twilio as we.

- **Write for the reading level of a 10-13 year old** 
  - Use simple, short sentences and common words. 
  - Explain technical terms and write acronyms in full the first time a user sees them. 
  - Test the reading age of your content here [link to readability tester]**

- **Be inclusive of people and devices**
  - Avoid *click, tap, touch* instructions as not every device supports touch. 
  - Instead, use *select* to instruct a user to interact.
  - Avoid relying on drectional or color-based cues. *To the right, the blue button* – are problematic for responsive products or users who see colors differently. 
  - Instead, write *the main menu* or *the dropdown menu*. Name the component or area you’re referencing.

- **Write as if the user is in a rush** 
  - Avoid repetition and padding. 
  - Phrases we use when writing formally or presenting – *please note, so, in fact, in other words* – should be cut.
  - Chunk content and use headings to help the user scan for what they need.

- **Be direct and straightforward** 
  - Lead with the reason (why), by front-loading messages with words that address the user’s needs.
  - Leave the user with a clear instruction of how to address that need. 
  - Avoid relying on company/industry jargon, idioms, or cultural references to communicate what you mean. 
  - Use the words that are most familiar to the user.

- **It’s ok to bend grammatical rules to sound natural** 
  - End sentences with prepositions – *of, with, for* – if it sounds less awkward.
  - And you can start sentences with *But* or *And*. 
  - Use contractions with pronouns – *it’s, there’s, you’ll, we’ll, you’re* – to sound conversational. 

<Callout>
  <CalloutTitle>Exception: avoid contractions in error messages</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    Avoid contractions in negative scenarios – when a user is stressed, their comprehension suffers. 
    Often users will read *can’t* as *can*, missing the -’t at the end. 
    Write out error messages or destructive action warnings in full.

## Punctuation

#### Ampersands &
**Avoid using ampersands.** In exceptional circumstances, if space is unavoidably restricted or it's part of a product/brand name, use "&"

**Do use "and" instead of "&"**
- *Voice and messaging*
- *Create and submit a Regulatory Bundle.*
- *Messages sent from AT&T to Twilio numbers are not impacted.*

**Don't use "&" just to make content shorter**
- *Storage & taxes are charged at the end of each month.*
- *Enables cross-channel messaging with SMS & WhatsApp.*


  <Callout>
    <CalloutTitle>Why?</CalloutTitle>
    <CalloutText> Using "and" rather than the ampersand symbol (&) supports localization and users with lower literacy or cognitive impairments. 
    Some screen readers can’t interpret the code behind an ampersand, which obscures the meaning for the user. 
    </CalloutText>
  </Callout>

#### Apostrophes '
**Do use apostrophes to indicate possession or to indicate missing letters.**
- The APIs of Twilio > Twilio's APIs
  - *The phone number's prefix.*
  - *Choose from one of SendGrid's responsive email designs* 
- You are > you're

**Don't use apostrophes to make a plural.** 
- *Upgrade to buy phone number's.*
- *Install plugin's*
- *SID's* 

#### Commas ,
**Do use the serial or 'Oxford' comma in a list of 3 or more items.**
- *You can customize the agent desktop, channels, interaction routing, and reporting.* 

#### Exclamation marks !
**Do use a single exclamation mark to support a celebratory phrase.**
- *Congratulations! You sent your first email!*

**Don't use multiple exclamation marks in line**
- *Congratulations!!!*

**Don't use exclamation marks to draw attention.** Design should draw the eye, not punctuation.
- *Error! File not found.*

#### Hyphens and dashes - —
**Do use hyphens (-) to create compound words.** Hyphens never have a space either side. 
- *Add-on feature*

**Do use en-dashes indicate a range of values** (time, dates, numerical amounts). En-dashes never have a space either side. 
- *0-50 agents*
- If your system does not support en-dashes, use a hyphen to indicate range.

**Em-dashes (—) create an emphatic pause in a phrase.** Em-dashes should have a space either side. 
- Example to come 

#### Parentheses (brackets)

#### Periods

#### Quotation marks " "

#### Semicolons
**Avoid using semicolons.** In formal writing, semicolons are useful. In product content, they're messy and confusing.
- Use commas to separate items in a list. 
- List complex items that already contain a comma with bullet points.
  - Montgomery, Alabama
  - Juneau, Alaska
  - Phoenix, Arizona
- Use sentences to separate thoughts or independent clauses. Sentences can be short. 

## Grammar and formatting

#### Abbreviations
#### Acronyms
#### American English
#### Bold and italics
#### Capitalization
#### Code snippets
#### Dates 
#### I/You/We/Us
#### Lists
**Bulleted lists** 
- Use bulleted lists for items linked by a topic. 
- Make the list topic clear in the sentence or heading that precedes it.

**Numbered lists**
- Use numbered lists for items to be done or understood in a sequence.

**Do**
- Start each list item with the same part of speech – usually a noun or verb – to make the list ‘parallel’.
- Use a full point if your list item is a sentence.
- Be consistent if using a full point at the end of a list item. Do it for every item, or none.

**Don’t** 
- Punctuate the end of an item in a vertical list with a comma.
- Introduce a list with ellipses “...”

**Sentence lists**
- Use a sentence list if you’re explaining a short process, noting up to four options, or highlighting up to four key points. You just read a sentence list.
- Sentence lists should be used for no more than four items. Over four? List with bullet points.
- Use the Oxford comma before the last item in a sentence list.

#### Numbers
#### Sentence case
**Do use sentence case everywhere** unless specifically guided otherwise.
- This is sentence case. (Use this.) 
- This is Title Case. (Rarely use this, and only if directed.)
- THIS IS ALL CAPS. (Don’t use this.)

Sentence case makes content feel more human and approachable. It’s also generally easier to read.

#### Time
